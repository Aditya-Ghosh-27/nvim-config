# nvim-config
This repository contains all my personalised setup and plugins that I use in my neovim. All of the basic configuration of my neovim will also be included in this repository. I will try to keep it as beginner friendly as possible

### Point to Note:
All of these will only be applicabe to Windows OS only.
